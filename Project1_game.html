		<h2>EAFC 24</h2>
		<p>EAFC 24 is a football video game that is played on Playstation Consoles, Xbox Consoles, Gaming PCs and mobile phones. This game is produced by EA Sports and was part of The FIFA franchise until August 2023. The first FIFA game was released September 2002 and has been released every year since then as a different version of the game, the last one being FIFA23. As frustrating as the game can be sometimes, it features almost real life experience of what it means to lead your favorite football team to wins, draws and losses. It has selective tabs for playing against opponents online and earning rewards as you win. With various options like Career mode and Tournaments, you can move on to being the player on the field or the brain behind the games. It really is one of the best designed games in the world.  </p>
